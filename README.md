Things you will learn üéñÔ∏è

In this assignment, you will develop a more comprehensive event management Android application. This project will equip you with the skills to build such an application.

This app will enable users to create, edit, and manage their events. Users will be able to categorize their events. (Note: the relationship between category and events is one-to-many. i.e. one category can contain one or more events. But one event can only be part of one category).

    You'll utilize the Options Menu to provide users with additional actions and settings. 

    A Navigation View will be implemented for clear and consistent in-app navigation. 

    To promote user interaction, you'll integrate Floating Action Buttons (FABs) for quick and accessible actions. 

    The application's core content will be structured using Fragments, a modular approach for managing different UI elements. 

    To display scrollable lists of data efficiently, you'll leverage Recycler View. 

    For persistent data storage, you'll implement ArrayLists and SharedPreferences, allowing the app to save and retrieve data even after it's closed. 

By combining these elements, you'll create a well-rounded and user-friendly Android application.
